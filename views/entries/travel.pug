	h3 Tips & Tricks
	ul
		li Have your partner scout out fuel stops before you get there by looking at Google Maps overhead imagery. Helps to not waste time on tight or sketchy places. Also check out campgrounds you might want to stay at using google maps.
		li Have a plan in place for dealing with a flat on the camper. Not saying it will happen, but seems to be more common with trailer tires. If you will be dealing with it yourself, do a change out before you hit the road (for the same reason as above). If you won't be dealing with a flat, check your AAA, Good Sam's, or whom ever else offers that service and learn that process before hitting the road.
